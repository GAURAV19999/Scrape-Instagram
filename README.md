# Scrape-Instagram
Uses Instaloader API

Need to have chromedriver installed in same folder as python file

Worked with MSBA team to scrape 400 posts from Zaraâ€™s Instagram containing likes, captions, comments, images, and labels with google cloud vision
Applied weighted sum of likes and comments to get engagement then applied TF-IDF, topic modeling (LDA)
